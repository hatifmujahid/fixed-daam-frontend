              Welcome to <strong>FixedDaam</strong> ("the Platform", "we", "us", or "our"), a price-locking

              <li><strong>Buyer</strong> — a registered user who browses products and locks in prices.</li>
              <li><strong>Merchant</strong> — a registered business that lists products and fulfills orders.</li>
              <li><strong>Price Lock</strong> — a commitment by the Buyer to purchase a product at the price displayed at the time of locking, and a commitment by the Merchant to honor that price.</li>
              <li><strong>Order</strong> — a Price Lock transaction initiated by a Buyer, identified by a unique QR code.</li>
              <li><strong>QR Code</strong> — a unique scannable code issued to the Buyer upon locking a price, used for order collection.</li>

            <p>
              You must be at least 18 years of age to use the Platform. By creating an account, you
              represent and warrant that you are of legal age and that all information you provide is
              accurate and complete. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts found to
              be in violation of this requirement.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-3">4. Account Registration</h2>
            <p>
              To use the Platform, you must register an account and verify your email address. You are
              responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all
              activity that occurs under your account. You agree to notify us immediately at
              <strong> support@fixeddaam.com</strong> if you suspect any unauthorized use of your account.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Merchants must register as a "business" account type. Providing false business information
              is a material breach of these Terms and may result in immediate account termination.

            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-3">5. Price Locking Mechanism</h2>
            <p>
              When a Buyer locks a price on a product, a binding order is created between the Buyer and
              the Merchant at the displayed price. The following order lifecycle applies:
            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 mt-2">
              <li><strong>Locked</strong> — the Buyer has committed to the price; the Merchant is notified.</li>
              <li><strong>Ready</strong> — the Merchant has prepared the order for collection.</li>
              <li><strong>Delivered</strong> — the Buyer has collected the order using their QR code.</li>
            </ol>
            <p className="mt-2">
              A locked price is a binding commitment. Neither party may unilaterally cancel a confirmed order
              except as provided in Section 7 (Cancellations and Refunds).
            </p>

              <li>Buyers must present their QR code when collecting an order.</li>
              <li>Buyers must not share, transfer, or duplicate QR codes.</li>
              <li>Buyers acknowledge that price locks are made in good faith and that the Platform is not responsible for Merchant inventory errors beyond what is provided in Section 7.</li>

              <li>All cancellation requests are reviewed by the Platform. Approved cancellations will result in a full refund to the Buyer's original payment method within 5–10 business days.</li>
              <li>Disputes between Buyers and Merchants must first be submitted to the Platform for mediation before any external proceedings.</li>
