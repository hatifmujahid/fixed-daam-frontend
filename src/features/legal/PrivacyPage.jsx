              <li>To facilitate price-lock transactions between Buyers and Merchants.</li>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-3">4. How We Share Your Information</h2>
            <p>We do not sell your personal data. We share it only in the following circumstances:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mt-2">
              <li><strong>Between Buyers and Merchants</strong> — when a price lock is created, the Merchant receives the Buyer's name and order details necessary to fulfill the order. Buyers see Merchant product and contact information.</li>
              <li><strong>Service providers</strong> — we use third-party services for cloud hosting, email delivery, and file storage. These providers process data on our behalf and are bound by confidentiality obligations.</li>
              <li><strong>Legal requirements</strong> — we may disclose your data if required by law, court order, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Citisoft Solution, our users, or the public.</li>
              <li><strong>Business transfers</strong> — in the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your data may be transferred to the acquiring entity, who will be bound by this Privacy Policy.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-3">5. QR Code Data</h2>
            <p>
              Each order generates a unique QR code tied to the Buyer's account and order details. QR codes
              are stored securely and are valid only for their associated order. They do not contain your
              payment information. Scanning a QR code reveals only the order identifier to the Merchant for
              fulfillment purposes.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-3">6. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>
              We retain your account and order data for as long as your account is active or as needed to
              provide services. After account deletion, we may retain certain data for up to 90 days for
              legal, fraud prevention, and backup purposes, after which it is permanently deleted or
              anonymized. Transaction records may be retained for up to 7 years to comply with financial
              recordkeeping obligations.

            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-3">7. Data Security</h2>
            <p>
              We implement industry-standard security measures including:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mt-2">
              <li>Passwords hashed using bcrypt before storage.</li>
              <li>Authentication via signed JWTs with expiration windows.</li>
              <li>HTTPS encryption for all data in transit.</li>
              <li>Rate limiting on authentication endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks.</li>
              <li>Restricted access to production databases.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-2">

              at your own risk and are encouraged to use a strong, unique password.
